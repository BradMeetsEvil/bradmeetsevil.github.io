	<h1>Alison Marchand and Brad Lewis Wedding 2019</h1>
	<p>
		We would love to share this memory with you all in August from the 18th to the 25th of 2019 at the Grand Bahia Principe Tulum Resort. The wedding ceremony will take place at 2pm on August 22, 2019. We would like to ask if everyone invited through this Facebook event could please RSVP as soon as possible through this Facebook event if you will be joining us in Mexico so we can start to get a headcount. There is a limit on total guests so we are not able to offer plus ones. We will also be hosting a reception in Thunder Bay on August 31st to provide an opportunity to celebrate the marriage with those we were unable to invite or were unable to attend the ceremony in Mexico (we will be sending out separate invitations for that reception at a later date). If you choose to come to Mexico and stay off resort, day pass purchases are available for the 22nd to come onto the resort for the ceremony. We will be using this event to post pertinent trip and wedding information so stay tuned! We hope to see you there on the beach üòé‚òÄÔ∏è - Ali and Brad
